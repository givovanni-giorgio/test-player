# Preface
This script has been created in order to somehow maintain process of imagining new devices. Since we made a lot of mistakes sending foulty devices to our customers, hopefully it will prevent that from happening. The initial idea is to use Pester as a testing frameworks. Write cases wchich need to be tested and using xml file load, all the test that need to be run on the device. 

## Files
    
1. Test.test.ps1
2. Settings.xml
3. Pester

## Description

**Test.test.ps1** file is the main file where all the functions are written
**.xml** include configuration which has to be declared by us before running the script. The Settings.xml file can be configured to dervice of of it's date form the device by another script. <br>
**Pester** pester module.
